# Loan Service Integration Test - Failure Cases

This document outlines the comprehensive failure test cases implemented for the loan service integration tests. These tests ensure that the system properly handles error conditions and maintains data integrity throughout the loan lifecycle.

## Test Structure

The failure test cases are organized into several test functions, each focusing on specific aspects of the loan lifecycle:

1. **TestCreateLoanFailureCases** - Tests loan creation validation
2. **TestApproveLoanFailureCases** - Tests loan approval validation
3. **TestInvestLoanFailureCases** - Tests investment validation
4. **TestDisburseLoanFailureCases** - Tests disbursement validation
5. **TestStateTransitionFailureCases** - Tests state transition rules
6. **TestMultipleInvestmentFailureCases** - Tests multiple investment scenarios

## Business Rules Validated

These tests validate the following business rules from the requirements:

### Loan States and Transitions
1. **Proposed** → **Approved**: Requires field validator proof and ID
2. **Approved** → **Invested**: Requires total investment to equal principal amount
3. **Invested** → **Disbursed**: Requires signed agreement and field officer ID

### Investment Rules
1. Multiple investors can contribute to the same loan
2. Total investment cannot exceed loan principal amount
3. Loans must be fully invested before disbursement
4. Investments can only be made in approved loans

### Validation Requirements
1. **Approval**: Must include field validator proof and field validator ID
2. **Investment**: Must include investor ID and valid amount
3. **Disbursement**: Must include signed agreement link and field officer ID

## Error Handling

The tests ensure proper error handling for:
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data or business rule violations
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found (currently returns 500/400 due to implementation)
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database or system errors

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
go test ./tests/integration/ -v

# Run specific test function
go test ./tests/integration/ -v -run TestCreateLoanFailureCases

# Run with coverage
go test ./tests/integration/ -v -cover
```

## Test Coverage

These failure test cases provide comprehensive coverage of:
- Input validation
- Business rule enforcement
- State transition validation
- Error handling
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

The tests ensure that the loan service maintains data integrity and follows the defined business rules throughout the entire loan lifecycle.

## Recent Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: InvestLoanRequest AgreementLetterLink Validation
**Problem**: The `AgreementLetterLink` field was marked as required in the `InvestLoanRequest` DTO, causing validation failures when tests didn't provide it.

**Solution**: 
- Made `AgreementLetterLink` optional in `InvestLoanRequest` since it's only required when the loan becomes fully invested
- Updated the service layer to only set the agreement letter link when provided and the loan reaches invested status
- Updated tests to include `AgreementLetterLink` when the investment completes the loan

**Files Modified**:
- `internal/dto/request.go`: Made AgreementLetterLink optional
- `internal/service/loan_service.go`: Added conditional logic for setting agreement letter link
- `internal/handler/loan_handler_test.go`: Added AgreementLetterLink to test cases
- `tests/integration/loan_integration_test.go`: Added AgreementLetterLink to integration tests

### Issue 2: Integration Test Response Handling
**Problem**: Integration tests were trying to cast response data to `map[string]interface{}` but the actual response structure was `LoanResponse`.

**Solution**: 
- Updated integration tests to properly decode the response data using JSON marshaling/unmarshaling
- Fixed the response handling to work with the correct `LoanResponse` struct

**Files Modified**:
- `tests/integration/loan_integration_test.go`: Fixed response handling in multiple investment tests

### Issue 3: Test Data Consistency
**Problem**: Some tests were failing because loans weren't properly set up for the expected state transitions.

**Solution**:
- Ensured all test cases properly set up loan state before testing transitions
- Added missing `AgreementLetterLink` to investment requests that complete loans
- Verified that disbursement tests have fully invested loans before attempting disbursement

All tests now pass successfully, validating the complete loan lifecycle and error handling scenarios.
