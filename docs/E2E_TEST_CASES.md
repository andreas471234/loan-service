# Loan Service Integration Test Suite

This document outlines the comprehensive integration test suite for the loan service, designed to validate the complete loan lifecycle and ensure robust error handling throughout the system.

## Test Structure Overview

The integration test suite is organized into four main categories, each focusing on specific aspects of the loan service:

### 1. **Happy Path Tests** - End-to-End Success Scenarios

- **TestMultipleInvestorScenario**: Tests collaborative investment scenarios with multiple investors
- **TestHealthCheckEndpoint**: Verifies system health and availability

### 2. **Validation Tests** - Input Validation and Data Integrity

- **TestInputValidationScenarios**: Comprehensive validation of all input parameters
- **Loan Creation Validation**: Required fields, amount validation, rate validation
- **Loan Approval Validation**: Field validator proof, image link validation, approval date recording
- **Investment Validation**: Investor ID, amount validation, investment limits
- **Disbursement Validation**: Required documents and officer information

### 3. **Business Rule Tests** - Domain Logic and State Management

- **TestBusinessRuleEnforcement**: Validates core business rules and state transitions
- **State Transition Rules**: Ensures proper workflow progression
- **Investment Limit Rules**: Validates investment constraints and limits

### 4. **Error Handling Tests** - System Resilience and Edge Cases

- **TestErrorHandlingScenarios**: Tests system behavior under error conditions
- **Non-existent Resource Handling**: Proper error responses for invalid resources
- **Duplicate Operation Handling**: Prevents duplicate state transitions

## Detailed Test Scenarios

### Happy Path Tests

#### Complete Loan Lifecycle Test

**Purpose**: Validates the entire loan processing workflow from application to disbursement.

**Test Flow**:

1. **Loan Application Creation**: Borrower submits loan application with required details
2. **Field Validation & Approval**: Field validator reviews and approves with proof documentation
3. **Investment Processing**: Single investor provides full funding
4. **Loan Disbursement**: Field officer processes final disbursement with signed agreement

**Validations**:

- ✓ Loan status progression: `proposed` → `approved` → `invested` → `disbursed`
- ✓ Auto-generated agreement letter link when fully invested
- ✓ Automatic approval date recording
- ✓ Disbursement date tracking
- ✓ Complete audit trail maintenance

#### Multiple Investor Scenario Test

**Purpose**: Tests collaborative investment scenarios where multiple investors fund a single loan.

**Test Flow**:

1. **Loan Setup**: Create and approve a large loan requiring multiple investors
2. **Sequential Investments**: Three investors contribute 40%, 35%, and 25% respectively
3. **Status Verification**: Loan remains `approved` until fully invested, then becomes `invested`

**Validations**:

- ✓ Partial investment tracking (40% → 75% → 100%)
- ✓ Status management during partial funding
- ✓ Auto-generated agreement link upon full investment
- ✓ Multiple investor support

### Validation Tests

#### Loan Creation Validation

**Scenarios Tested**:

- **Missing Required Fields**: Rejects loan creation without borrower ID
- **Invalid Principal Amount**: Rejects zero or negative loan amounts
- **Negative Interest Rate**: Rejects loans with negative interest rates

#### Loan Approval Validation

**Scenarios Tested**:

- **Missing Field Validator Proof**: Rejects approval without validation evidence
- **Invalid Image Link Format**: Rejects non-image URLs for field validation proof
- **Valid Image Link Processing**: Accepts proper image URLs and records approval date

**Image Link Validation**:

- ✓ Supports common image formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.webp`, `.svg`
- ✓ Validates HTTP/HTTPS protocols only
- ✓ Accepts URLs with image-related paths (`/images/`, `/photos/`, etc.)
- ✓ Rejects non-image files (PDF, TXT, etc.)

#### Investment Validation

**Scenarios Tested**:

- **Missing Investor ID**: Rejects investment without investor identification
- **Invalid Investment Amount**: Rejects zero or negative investment amounts
- **Exceeding Principal Amount**: Rejects investments that would exceed loan principal

#### Disbursement Validation

**Scenarios Tested**:

- **Missing Signed Agreement**: Rejects disbursement without signed agreement link
- **Missing Field Officer ID**: Rejects disbursement without officer identification

### Business Rule Tests

#### State Transition Rules

**Rules Validated**:

- **Cannot Invest in Proposed Loan**: Investments only allowed for approved loans
- **Cannot Disburse Partially Invested Loan**: Full investment required before disbursement
- **Cannot Approve Already Approved Loan**: Prevents duplicate approval operations

#### Investment Limit Rules

**Rules Validated**:

- **Total Investment Limit**: Prevents total investments from exceeding loan principal
- **Sequential Investment Tracking**: Maintains accurate running totals
- **Status Management**: Proper status updates based on investment progress

### Error Handling Tests

#### Non-existent Resource Handling

**Scenarios Tested**:

- **Approve Non-existent Loan**: Returns appropriate error for invalid loan ID
- **Invest in Non-existent Loan**: Handles investment attempts on invalid loans
- **Disburse Non-existent Loan**: Manages disbursement attempts on invalid loans

#### Duplicate Operation Handling

**Scenarios Tested**:

- **Duplicate Disbursement**: Prevents multiple disbursements of the same loan
- **State Protection**: Maintains data integrity during duplicate operation attempts

## Business Rules Validated

### Loan Lifecycle Workflow

1. **Proposed** → **Approved**: Requires field validator proof and ID
2. **Approved** → **Invested**: Requires total investment to equal principal amount
3. **Invested** → **Disbursed**: Requires signed agreement and field officer ID

### Investment Management

- Multiple investors can contribute to the same loan
- Total investment cannot exceed loan principal amount
- Loans must be fully invested before disbursement
- Investments can only be made in approved loans

### Data Validation Requirements

- **Approval**: Must include field validator proof (image link) and field validator ID
- **Investment**: Must include investor ID and valid amount (> 0)
- **Disbursement**: Must include signed agreement link and field officer ID

## Error Response Standards

The system provides consistent error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data or business rule violations
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found (currently returns 500/400 due to implementation)
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database or system errors

## Test Execution
